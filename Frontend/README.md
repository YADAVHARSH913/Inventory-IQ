## Stock Management System 

The Stock Management System is a web app that helps track and manage inventory. Its backend provides a RESTful API to handle stock operations like managing brands, purchases, and items. Users can add, update, delete, and search stock, as well as filter items by category or supplier. The system also has user authentication with role-based permissions.

## Packages Used:
